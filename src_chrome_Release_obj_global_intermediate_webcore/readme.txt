Why: 
This folder is not part of WebCore/ project, it is auto-generated by Chromium bindings python code. However in order to mediate innerHTML, document.title, document.URL and window.navigator, which are all const functions in their respective classes, we need to mediate here instead of at their DOM implementations. Because we use filehandler in writeThirdPartyLog(), and that filehandler is a member of class document, const prevents us from using filehandlers in writeThirdPartyLog() if we define it const.

How:
Put this folder at src\chrome\Release\obj\global_intermediate\webcore, overwriting previous files. src\chrome\Debug\obj\global_intermediate\webcore is acutally the same as this one.
